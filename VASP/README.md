# VASP Input Files for MLIP Training

This directory contains VASP input files used to generate density functional theory (DFT) reference data for training machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for lithium niobate (LiNbO₃). The resulting MLIP, trained using VASP on-the-fly algorithms, is subsequently deployed in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations using LAMMPS.
