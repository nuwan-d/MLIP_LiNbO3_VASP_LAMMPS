# LAMMPS Input Files for MLIP-Based MD Simulations

This directory contains LAMMPS input files and post-processing scripts for performing uniaxial tensile simulations of lithium niobate (LiNbO₃) using a machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained on density functional theory (DFT) data generated with VASP.

The workflow demonstrated here applies the trained MLIP within LAMMPS to compute the stress–strain response under uniaxial loading along the crystallographic *z*-direction.
